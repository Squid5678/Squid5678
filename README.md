## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aalind Tyagi, and I am a current junior at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
Here, you'll find various projects that I have worked on in the past, 
as well as current projects that I am working on.

My current work can be split up into 3 major categories:
- Robotic planning algorithms to enhance planning algorithms
through LLM prompt engineering and vision-based autonomy.
- An open-source course website, https://mission4stem.com,
designed to leverage the power of a teaching community and
generative AI to provide high-quality education regardless
of who you are, where you are, or what you want to learn.
- A full-stack mobile application called LinkLeftovers GT,
where I work alongside Campus Kitches @ GT to improve
food re-distribution across the greater Atlanta area.

Feel free to reach out at atyagi80@gatech.edu.
